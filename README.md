This was a school project. A school project where I combined different languages with API's. I used a Live Score API for my project with PHP. <br><br>
**Project Description** <br>
In this project I work with HTML and PHP to create a website where a football club administrator can hand out fines for the players. 
I wanted to make it easier for people so I mainly focused the design on mobile application. I unfortunately don't have the best understanding in using React Native, so that's why I used HTML and CSS/Bootstrap. I had to combine my project with API's so I decided to use a Football API where you can see all the upcoming games and a football calendar for all the upcoming football matches. <br><br>
The offical documentation for the API can be found here: https://live-score-api.com/
